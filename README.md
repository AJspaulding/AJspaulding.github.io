                                                     AJ spaulding photography website 



The main purpose of the site is to showcase what I learned in code Louisville and to showcase my photography skills. This is a single page site. the links for other pages do not work. the phone number and email does work.



                                                                       HTML


All of the HMTL was my own creation 

                                                                       CSS

 90% of the css is my own. I think the only CSS that isn't mine was the link colors in the 3 different states that was copied form a site.

 most of the css relates to the navbar.



#logo{
 margin-left: -10%;
 max-height: 90em;
}

The logo was too far to the some reason  so i moved the margin and set max height.



footer {
  margin-top: 10%;
}
added maging to the top to created seperation from pictures.


.header, footer{
  background-color: #dfd9d9;
  max-height: 85px;
}

added background color and set max height of footer and header.





                                                                     JavaScript


$(document).ready(function() {  $('#sale').delay(1000).fadeIn(2600).delay(3000).slideUp(2600);
});

// javascript unhides sale div then fades in then holds for 3 seconds and then slides up.
