AJ spaulding photography website

The maid purpose of the site is to showcase what I learned in code Louisville nd to showcase my photography skills.


all of the HMTl was my own creation as well as 90% of the css I think the only CSS that isn't mine was the link colors in the 3 different states that was copied form a site.

most of the css relates to the navbar.
