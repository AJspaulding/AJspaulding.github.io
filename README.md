AJ spaulding photography website

The main purpose of the site is to showcase what I learned in code Louisville and to showcase my photography skills.


All of the HMTL was my own creation as well as 90% of the css I think the only CSS that isn't mine was the link colors in the 3 different states that was copied form a site.
Also most of the modal code wasn't mine.
most of the css relates to the navbar.

JavaScript.
